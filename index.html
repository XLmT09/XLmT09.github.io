        <p>I'm in my final year of Computer Science at Royal Holloway University of London. During my industry year at HPE, I had the opportunity to contribute to developing and maintaining some of HPE's industry-leading and next-generation storage products. I'm looking forward to exploring future opportunities in software development and technology fields where I can apply my skills to keep learning and contribute to creating meaningful solutions.</p>
